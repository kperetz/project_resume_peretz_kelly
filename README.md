## Resources
I used this as a cheat sheet for git commands in terminal: https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/

jQuery plugin #1 was used to make a pop up window of the screen grab of my website's homepage. When you click on the picture, it pops up to take over the screen, press back button to close the pop up: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/

jQuery plugin #2 was used to make the h1 slide down while you are scrolling. When scrolling down, the header slides down on top of the rest of the content.: https://plugins.jquery.com/rlSmooth/

I used this resource to help create hover effects for my custom jQuery code. When hovering over each section, it changes the background color to pink. :https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_hover.asp
